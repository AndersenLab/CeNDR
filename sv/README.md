# SV script

This script is used to convert a bed file containing structural variants into a VCF file that can be used by VCF-kit (and the indel primer tool) to generate primers.

In the future - it is more ideal to bring these types of variant calls together directly from VCFs as this is a bit of a hacky solution.
