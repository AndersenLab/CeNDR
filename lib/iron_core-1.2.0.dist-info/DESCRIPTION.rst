Iron.io common library
----------------------

This package offers common functions for Iron.io APIs and services. It does not wrap 
any APIs or contain API-specific features, but serves as a common base that wrappers
may be built on. Users looking for API wrappers should instead look at 
iron_worker_python and iron_worker_mq.
