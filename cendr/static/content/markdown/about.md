### What is _C. elegans_?

_Caenorhabditis elegans_ is a non-parasitic nematode roundworm that lives in rotting material and eats bacteria and fungi. Because this species grows easily and quickly in the laboratory, it is a powerful model to learn about human development, complex behaviors, and evolutionary processes. For more information about _C. elegans_, see its [wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caenorhabditis_elegans); or to learn about its history at [wormclassroom.org](http://wormclassroom.org/short-history-c-elegans-research).
