#### June 2017 CeNDR Updates

<p>The site has undergone a large update! Our 1.1.0 release brings the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>A revamped genome browser, which offers the ability to download data in a tab-delimited format (TSV).</li>
<li>The release of a larger set of strains (our 2017-05-31 set). The site now has 249 isotypes available, and a fourth set of strains.</li>
<li>The Data page has been renamed as the 'releases' page to reflect the fact that our set of genomic data continues to evolve.</li>
<li>Many other bug-fixes and minor enhancements.</li>
</ul>

<p>As always, we highly value community feedback. Please let us know what issues you run in to and how we can continue to improve the site.</p>
