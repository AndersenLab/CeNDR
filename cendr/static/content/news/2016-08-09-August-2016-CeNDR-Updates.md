#### August 2016 CeNDR Updates

* We have added [gene pages](/gene/pot-2) which feature mappings, variants, and more.
* We have added an [API](http://docs.elegansvariation.apiary.io/)!
* We will begin versioning the website, snp-sets, and strain data. The website is now considered to be version 1.0.0!
* An issue with strain names being returned with phenotype data was fixed.
* Variant correlation was added to reports. Users can now see what the maximum correlation is for a gene and look at the variants with predicted effects within them!
* A [Homolog Search](/data/browser/) function has been added!
