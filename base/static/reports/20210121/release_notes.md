The <strong>20210121</strong> release includes genotypes from whole-genome sequences and reduced representation (RAD) sequencing. Genotypes are compared for concordance, and strains that are 99.95% identical to each other are [grouped into isotypes]({{ url_for("primary.help_item", filename="FAQ", _anchor="strain-groups") }}). One strain within each isotype is the reference strain for that isotype. To look up isotype assignment, see Alignment Data tab. All isotype reference strains are [available on CeNDR]({{ url_for("strain.strain_catalog") }}).
