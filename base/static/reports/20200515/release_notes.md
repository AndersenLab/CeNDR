This release <strong>ADD YYYYMMDD HERE</strong> includes genotypes from whole-genome sequences and reduced representation (RAD) sequencing. 
Genotypes are compared for concordance, and strains that are XX% identical to 
each other are [grouped into isotypes]({{ url_for("primary.help_item", filename="FAQ", _anchor="strain-groups") }}).
One strain within each isotype is the reference strain for that isotype.
All isotype reference strains are [available on CeNDR]({{ url_for("strain.strain_catalog") }}).
The genotype data for all whole-genome sequenced strains are available below.
